## Accessible interactive data visualizations in Python with Bokeh

Bokeh aims to empower as many people as possible to harness the power of complex
data by making it accessible through interactive, browser-based visualizations.
In addition to significant direct usage in the scientific community,
Bokeh powers several diagnostic and visualization functions in other core
scientific workflow tools like ArViz, Dask, and the HoloViz toolkit.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 1.3 billion people
(i.e., 1 in 6 individuals) experience a disability, and nearly 2.2 billion people (1 in 5 individuals) have vision impairment.
This means that from the ~200k monthly visitors to <https://docs.bokeh.org/>
roughly ~33k are people with disabilities, and ~40k have some form of vision
impairment, all spread around ~100 countries, including several
non-English-native countries.

The proposed work aims to add core accessibility affordances to allow disabled
and international users to work with Bokeh-based visualizations through four
main work items or missions.

These have been identified with the following `mission: *` labels:

<!-- TODO: add link to mission issues -->
* [`mission: accessibility ‚ôøÔ∏è`](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/issues?q=label:%22mission:+accessibility+%E2%99%BF%EF%B8%8F%22+): [Auditing and extending core plotting functions to include accessibility affordances]
* [`mission: theming ü™Ñ`](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/issues?q=sort:updated-desc+is:open+label:%22mission:+theming+%F0%9F%AA%84%22): [Refactor the theme and styling systems]
* [`mission: i18n üí¨`](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/issues?q=sort:updated-desc+is:open+label:%22mission:+i18n+%F0%9F%92%AC%22): [Internationalization and translation improvements]
* [`mission: maintenance üå±`](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/issues?q=+label:%22mission:+maintenance+%F0%9F%8C%B1%22+): [Dedicated testing, communication, and continued maintenance]

You can also follow the progress of the tasks on the [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/Quansight-Labs/projects/20) üóÇÔ∏è.

## Estimated completion üìÜ

The project is scheduled to take approximately two years, from June 2024 to June 2026.
We have established time-based milestones at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.
Some tasks are labeled as `type: stretch` which indicates stretch goals in case there's time and resources to tackle them.

These milestones are available in the project [Milestones tab](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/milestones).

## Community üå±

<!-- TODO: define meeting times with people -->

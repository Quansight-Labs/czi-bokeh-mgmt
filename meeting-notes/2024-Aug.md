## üìù Agenda
<!-- Add any progress made during the last month and 
 other items needed discussion with the rest of the team -->

- [ ] Updates and any blockers
    - Gabriel / Mezu: testing is coming along. From where I stand, I think it's totally doable for Chiemezuo to have a PR or set of PRs that add a few accessibility tests to the repo (Playwright, unit, etc.)
        - Note: we are not creating a separate folder for accessibility tests but rather mixing them with other types of tests (unit, Playwright, etc.)
        - Possible future blocker: some of the TypeScript in Bokeh looks quite advanced to me, so this may be something I struggle with when it comes time to add new or modify existing BokehJS code
            - Mateusz: Yes, there is some complexity, but we mostly be reusing exisitng work.
        - Chiemezuo has a draft pull request open where you can follow along with the work adding Playwright to Bokeh - [make npx-compatible version of playwright tests #14032
](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/14032)
   - Frank: 
       - First pass at testing various plot tools: https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/bokeh-a11y-audit/tree/main/plot-tools
       - Next step is agregating findings
       - No blockers right now
       - Looking for feedback on the process of sharing findings
       - Inital evidence gathering - Open a PR, drop a note on Slack so folks are aware on ongoing work

- [ ] Tania: I'd like to discuss next steps needed for [Refactor Bokeh's theme and styling systems](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/issues/2)
    - [ ] What would be the next actions after [#13828 Add support for CSS-based theming on the canvas](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/13828)****
    - Mateusz: New PR [#14028 Add support for dual canvas and DOM/CSS rendering](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/14028)
    - What's next: [CZI R6 label]( https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/labels/grant%3A%20CZI%20R6), we don't have a meta-issue yet

## General Notes

- Frank's auditing work is being carried out in [bokeh-a11y-audit repo](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/bokeh-a11y-audit). Watch the repo if you want to get GitHub notifications!
- Frank's walkthrough of https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/bokeh-a11y-audit/blob/main/plot-tools/explanation-purpose.md
    - Explanations for plots tools - tooltips have some info about the tool, but it's not enough
    - Need docs to aid people viewing the final plots
    - For instance, the question mark can go to end-user docs instead of end(?)-developer (folks creating Bokeh plots)

## üöÄ Action items

- [ ] Mateusz - Create a meta-issues with roadmap to foundations for future fixes
- [ ] Pavithra - Issue for end-user docs

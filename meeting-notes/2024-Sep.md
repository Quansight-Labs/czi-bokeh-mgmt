## üìù Agenda
<!-- Add any progress made during the last month and 
 other items needed discussion with the rest of the team -->

- Tania: Same request as last month for Mateusz, as Gabriel will be ramping up on hours for the grant we need to have items/meta issue for 
    - [ ] https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/issues/2 
    - [ ] https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/issues/10
There are issues labelled for the current grant but these are not enough to scope and work on the above deliverables (ref: https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues?q=sort:updated-desc+is:open+label:%22grant:+CZI+R6%22)

- [ ] General progress check-in

- Gabriel:
    - Chiemezuo's internship is wrapping up on September 30.
    - Looking back to [our last meeting](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/blob/main/meeting-notes/2024-Aug.md), we did not quite hit the goal of writing a set of custom tests for Playwright, unit, and integration 
    - But! The two big outcomes:
        - Chiemezuo did a great job [documenting and kicking off a discussion of Axe-core abilities and limitations](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/discussions/14057)
        - We figured out how to slot Playwright into Bokeh. Chiemezuo has a PR: [make npx-compatible version of playwright tests #14032](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/14032)
- **Question**: How do other interactive viz libraries render visualisations?
    - Generally SVG
    - Other approaches: HTML, SVG + canvas, SVG + DOM (sometimes with 3Djs)
    - The BokehJS canvas approach was chosen to provide performant rendering of high-volume (many data points, 100s of thousands or more) plots. Also SVG was not as widely supported across browsers (and applications) when BokehJS was initially developed.
    - On accessibility:
        - SVG -> can inherit from CSS
        - Canvas -> places more onus on the maintainer/developer
- Pavithra:
    - [Setting up a docs website for the audit findings](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/czi-bokeh-mgmt/issues/14)
    - Will be working on docs for plot-end-users

- Frank:
    - Auditing the plotting interface, 65-70% complete (will push some work later today)
    - Might complete this mid-October
    - There will be a lot of evidence across the audits, so perhaps grouping topics would be a good approach to consolidate and present findings (this might take a whole month). 

- Mateusz:
    - Continuing work on selectable-text support on the canvas
    - Working on: [Add support for dual canvas and DOM/CSS rendering](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/14028)
    - Initial experiments on keyboard support
## General notes

:link: [Data navigator](https://www.frank.computer/data-navigator/#)
 - Potential challenges we will encounter when working on a Python implementation: there is no singular UI for data representation/rendering

* Time offs:
    * Mateusz is off at the end of Sept
    * Tania is off at the end of Oct-early November
    * Frank will have low availability in mid and end of Oct, during confs

- PyCon US 2025, we can propose a talk about this work (CFP should be opening in October, @trallard will be there)
 
## üöÄ Action items

- [ ] Next call (November): start with design-related discussions (will invite Isabela/Smera)
